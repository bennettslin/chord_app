Is This a Chord?
================

This program prints out the interval-class prime form and type of chord, if any, of a given set of pitch-classes inputted by the user in duodecimal form.

Further coding to do:
* check that pitches aren't repeated
* check that only three or four pitches are given
* return an error for non-duodecimal input
* graphical user interface with keyboard input
